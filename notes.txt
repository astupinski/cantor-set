finitely need real numbers and postulates about them.

we need sets of real numbers. you are going to use this.

℘ A = A → Set

set-of-reals = ℘ ℝ

an interval defines a set of reals.

interval (x,y) = { z | x < z < y }
_∪_ : ℘ A → ℘ A → ℘ A
X ∪ Y = (λ x → X x ∨ Y x)

for intersection you use ∧

now you can use ∪ and ℘ to define the nth cantor approximation

real-set = ℝ → Set
               ^^^
               prop



X : ℘ A
X = { x | φ(x) }
          ^
          characteristic function
          classically φ : A → 𝔹
          less-classically we want φ : A → prop
