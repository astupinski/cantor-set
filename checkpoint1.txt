Starting point from last week: getting data types needed 

goal from last week: creating the cantor set 

what was accomplished: we have all data types and cantor set finalized and defined 

who worked on what: we both worked to understand data types but did not accomplish much until meeting with you, thanks! Also, Vanessa proved the map! :) 

what are we stuck on: logically defining measure zero and uncountable 

what is still left to do: define and prove that the cantor set is measure zero and uncountable 

goal for next week: prove measure zero

fallback plan if we get stuck: come to your office hours lol
